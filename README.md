## 📌 Project Title

**Swift Retreat – Hotel Booking Management System**

---

## 🧠 Introduction

**Swift Retreat** is a web-based hotel booking management system developed to simplify and automate the reservation process for both hotel staff and customers. Traditional hotel booking methods often involve manual data entry, limited availability tracking, and poor communication between departments, leading to inefficiencies and customer dissatisfaction. Swift Retreat addresses these issues by providing a centralized platform where room availability, bookings, payments, and guest management are handled in real time.

Built using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, this system offers role-based access for administrators, staff, and customers. Customers can search for available rooms, make bookings, and manage their reservations online, while staff and administrators can oversee daily operations such as guest check-ins, room assignments, and invoice processing. With a user-friendly interface and responsive design, Swift Retreat aims to enhance operational efficiency and improve the overall guest experience, making it an ideal solution for small to mid-sized hotels.
