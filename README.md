## 🧠 Introduction

**Swift Retreat** is a web-based hotel booking management system designed to simplify and automate the reservation process while adhering to Shariah-compliant principles. In addition to solving common issues like double bookings, inefficient manual records, and lack of real-time updates, Swift Retreat incorporates Islamic values such as modesty, family-friendly accommodations, and optional amenities like prayer room access and halal-certified food services.

Built using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, this system offers role-based access for administrators, staff, and customers. Customers can browse for available rooms, filter for Shariah-compliant facilities, and make online reservations. Meanwhile, hotel staff and administrators can manage bookings, room statuses, and guest check-ins/check-outs. With responsive design and a user-friendly interface, Swift Retreat aims to enhance the hotel booking experience for all users, particularly those seeking services in line with Islamic values.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
