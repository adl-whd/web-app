## 🧠 Introduction

**Swift Retreat** is a web-based hotel booking management system designed to simplify and automate the reservation process while adhering to Shariah-compliant principles. In addition to solving common issues like double bookings, inefficient manual records, and lack of real-time updates, Swift Retreat incorporates Islamic values such as modesty, family-friendly accommodations, and optional amenities like prayer room access and halal-certified food services.

Built using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, this system offers role-based access for administrators, staff, and customers. Customers can browse for available rooms, filter for Shariah-compliant facilities, and make online reservations. Meanwhile, hotel staff and administrators can manage bookings, room statuses, and guest check-ins/check-outs. With responsive design and a user-friendly interface, Swift Retreat aims to enhance the hotel booking experience for all users, particularly those seeking services in line with Islamic values.

**The Challenges/Difficulties in developing the application**

1. I find the database part to be the most challenging, especially when the submitted data doesn't always get stored correctly in the phpMyAdmin tables.

   **Nur Amira Nabila**
1. has problem connected page with sidebar. having a hard time to merge layout page with sidebar layout
2. has an error on saving the room data. but the database save the data.
